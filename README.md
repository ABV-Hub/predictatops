# StratPickSupML

A series of modules for various steps involved in a stratigraphic pick supervised machine-learning prediction.

Development was in this repo: <a href="https://github.com/JustinGOSSES/MannvilleGroup_Strat_Hackathon">MannvilleGroup_Strat_Hackathon</a> but is now moving here as the code gets cleaned and modulized. This project is under active development. Significant portions of the code still only exist on MannvilleGroup_Strat_Hackathon repo at this time.

This code is the subject of an <a href="https://github.com/JustinGOSSES/StratPickSupML/blob/master/AAPG_Abstract_2019ACE.md">abstract</a> submitted to the AAPG ACE convention in 2019.
