A series of modules for various steps involved in a stratigraphic pick supervised machine-learning prediction.

Development was in this repo:`MannvilleGroup_Strat_Hackathon`.

.. _`MannvilleGroup_Strat_Hackathon`:https://github.com/JustinGOSSES/MannvilleGroup_Strat_Hackathon

Now development is gradually moving over to this repository. Once the approach has been narrowed, old approaches will be left in the MannvilleGroup_Strat_Hackathon repo and the winnowed down successful parts will be moved to this repository where further cleaning and organizing will turn the code into one or more modules with associated demo notebooks. 

This code is the subject of an `2019 AAPG ACE abstract`.
