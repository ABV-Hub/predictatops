Thanks to the people who build community
-----------------

This project was originally started before a Society of Exploration Geophysicist meeting in Houston as an Agile Hackathon Project. Thank for `Agile Scientific
<https://agilescientific.com/>`_. for putting on a great event and to the sponsors of that event for helping make it happen. 

Thank you as well to excellent discussion with the community of geoscientists who code on the `SWUNG (software underground) Slack Channel
<https://softwareunderground.org/slack/>`_.

Since the hackathon has since been worked largely by Justin with help from Licheng but we're very much accepting of pull requests and suggestions, no matter how small! Please check out the issues and contributing sections.


Project History
-----------------
Original Project Repository here, which might be of interest for some early ideas and some code that has yet to be made use of for mapping and plotting. There's also some people who have forked original repo and tried different things, which are interesting to check out.
