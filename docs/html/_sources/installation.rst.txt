From sources
------------

The sources for predictatops can be downloaded from the `Github repo`_.

You can either clone the public repository:

.. code-block:: console

    $ git clone git://github.com/JustinGOSSES/predictatops

Or download the `tarball`_:

.. code-block:: console

    $ curl  -OL https://github.com/JustinGOSSES/predictatops/tarball/master

Once you have a copy of the source, you can install it with:

.. code-block:: console

    $ python setup.py install


.. _Github repo: https://github.com/JustinGOSSES/predictatops
.. _tarball: https://github.com/JustinGOSSES/predictatops/tarball/master


Stable release
--------------
Eh, a stable release doesn't quite exist yet. Enough to work with but not enough to call it stable. It will be pushed to PyPy at some point soon, but has not been pushed there yet. When it does, it will run like this:

To install predictatops, run this command in your terminal:

.. code-block:: console

    $ pip install predictatops

This is the preferred method to install predictatops, as it will always install the most recent stable release.

If you don't have `pip`_ installed, this `Python installation guide`_ can guide
you through the process.
