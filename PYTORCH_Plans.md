### Pytorch plans
1. Figure out which saved file to start from
2. Add notes to help other do the same from fully prepped data with features and split.
3. Figure out what basic pytorch infrastructure to start from and find model example
4. Write code to train pytorch model & examine prediction results


### Possible other things
#### streamlit app to try different well logs and see results of prediction vs. reality.
#### streamlit app to add in your own wells and see results?
