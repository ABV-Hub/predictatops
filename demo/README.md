# NOTE FOR DEMO FOLDER

The plan is to put a series of notebooks in here that help show how the library is used. 

Currently, they notebooks don't have little or any commentary to help understand what is going on. 

Those words exist, but haven't yet been moved over here from the old repo. For the time being, there is some inline commented out commentary in the .py files themselves.
