This code is the subject of an <a href="https://github.com/JustinGOSSES/StratPickSupML/blob/master/AAPG_Abstract_2019ACE.md">abstract</a> submitted to the AAPG ACE convention in 2019.

Once the approach has been narrowed, old approaches will be left in the MannvilleGroup_Strat_Hackathon repo and the winnowed down successful parts will be moved to this repository where further cleaning and organizing will turn the code into one or more modules with associated demo notebooks.
